# MY PERSONAL PORTFOLIO SITE. VERSION 1.0 ðŸ˜‹

My latest project is a one-page portfolio website that showcases my best work and highlights my skills as a junior web developer. Built using semantic HTML5, CSS(SCSS) and JavaScript, this site not only displays my important information, but also reflects a bit of my personality. Check it out and let me know what you think! ðŸŒŸðŸ’».

### What I learned

So far I've learned how to create responsive web designs without using media queries, although I will be using them thanks to some good tips and advices I've found on the internet, my code looks much cleaner an readable.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css(scss)
--min-column-size: 25rem;
 grid-template-columns: 
    repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(var(--min-column-size), 100%), 1fr));
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
